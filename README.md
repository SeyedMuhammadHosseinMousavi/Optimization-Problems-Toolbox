Optimization Problems Toolbox
There are seven applications of Clustering, Regression, Image Quantization, Image Segmentation, Parallel Machine Scheduling (PMS), Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) as IDE and code format. All these problems could be solved by Harmony Search (HS), Deferential Evolution (DE), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization Algorithm (TLBO) algorithms on IDE or code forms. You can define your data (CSV or Image), algorithm, and parameters and run the application or code to get the results. HS is physique-based; DE is evolutionary; FA is swarm-based, and TLBO is human-based optimization algorithm.

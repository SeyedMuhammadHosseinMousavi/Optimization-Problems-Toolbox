<div align="justify">

There are seven applications of Clustering, Regression, Image Quantization, Image Segmentation, Parallel Machine Scheduling (PMS), Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) as IDE and code format. All these problems could be solved by Harmony Search (HS), Deferential Evolution (DE), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization Algorithm (TLBO) algorithms on IDE or code forms. You can define your data (CSV or Image), algorithm, and parameters and run the application or code to get the results. HS is physique-based; DE is evolutionary; FA is swarm-based, and TLBO is human-based optimization algorithm.

## Optimization Applications

The toolbox addresses the following optimization problems:

1. **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity.
2. **Regression**: Fitting models to data.
3. **Image Quantization**: Reducing image color spaces.
4. **Image Segmentation**: Dividing images into meaningful regions.
5. **Parallel Machine Scheduling (PMS)**: Optimizing task assignments to machines.
6. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Finding the shortest path for visiting a set of cities.
7. **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)**: Efficiently packing items into bins.
